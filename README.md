### Description
This application uses Express JS to create notes. We use the GET, POST and DELETE functionality of Express to create notes.

The user then can see the notes that are already existing in the data base and has the ability to create notes, and delete the existing notes. The new notes automatically get uploaded onto the data base once the user saves the note by clicking on the "Save" icon.
